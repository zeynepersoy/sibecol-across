We have had the opportunity to join the SPECTRE meeting on November 3rd.
SPECTRE is a group of researchers and practitioners who are interested in size-based theory in freshwater and marine systems. 

We presented our project at two times to accommodate different time zones and met several researchers that are experts in size spectrum to discuss ideas and collaboration opportunities.
