Long time no see. We are quite busy with many things but we are having progress!
Over the last months, we organized our second general meeting in May with the project contributors to inform them about the recent updates and plan the our next steps. We had fruitful discussions.

Later in the beginning of July, Ignasi attended the special session on **FROM BACTERIA TO WHALES: USING SIZE SPECTRA TO MEASURE GLOBAL CHANGE**, in the SEB (Society of Experimental Biology) Centenary Conference in Edinburgh, UK, in which he showed preliminary results from the ACROSS project.
