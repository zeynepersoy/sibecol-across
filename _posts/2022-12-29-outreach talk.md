Ignasi recently gave an outreach talk about our project at [Escorial Vic](https://www.escorialvic.org), in Vic, Catalonia on December 15th.

During our outreach talk, we had the opportunity to share more about what we do as researchers and show our ACROSS project as an example of a colllaborative project led by early-career researchers. We also gave a background and goals of our project, using the illustrations by [Jagoba Malumbres-Olarte](https://issuu.com/jmalumbresolarte/docs/portfolio_jmalumbres-olarte). We also had the chance to answer questions from the audience about having a scientific career.

We are planning to give other outreach talks next year to share our project with public.
