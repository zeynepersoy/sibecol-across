  Biodiversity is not distributed equally across the globe, and consistent variations of richness have been observed along latitudinal gradients with a myriad of hypotheses explaining such species diversity patterns. However, species-based processes (e.g., extinction and colonization rates) are more difficult to detect than changes in the biological performance of individuals (e.g., survival, reproduction) because the influence of environmental factors occurs at the individual level.

  Individual body size is a fundamental trait in organisms that plays a key role in bioenergetics and metabolism. Thus, community size structure (i.e., the distribution of individual body sizes regardless of species identity) may provide novel insights to understand global ecological patterns and to represent community facets. The ACROSS aims to (i) assess latitudinal gradients of community size spectrum of aquatic and terrestrial animals using a meta- analysis approach and (ii) determine species richness variations across these ecosystems. With the ACROSS project we will highlight the importance of using size-based approaches to reflect changes at a global scale, improving the knowledge base for the implementation of a macroecological theory of bioenergetics with individual body size as a key element. The ACROSS project will also involve international collaboration, result dissemination, and publication in top-ranked scientific journals.
