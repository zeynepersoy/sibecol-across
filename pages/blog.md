Our survey is out!

Our project aims to explore the spatial distribution of community body size distributions at a global scale using a meta-analytic approach. In order to improve our dataset, we are also interested in collecting individual body size data for local communities that haven‚Äôt been published. If you want to contribute to the project and share published or unpublished data from other sources (e.g. ‚Äúgrey literature‚Äù, preprint articles, articles not written in English‚Ä¶), we would greatly appreciate your help by answering this [our survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9DVfhsVUjM2RorJBvNU22TLjnaQu3-kAt5EiMbeB8SbiCOA/viewform)
