Biodiversity is not distributed equally across the globe, and consistent variations of richness have been observed along latitudinal gradients with a myriad of hypotheses explaining such species diversity patterns. However, species-based processes (e.g., extinction and colonization rates) are more difficult to detect than changes in the biological performance of individuals (e.g., survival, reproduction) because the influence of environmental factors occurs at the individual level. Individual **body size** is a fundamental trait in organisms that plays a key role in bioenergetics and metabolism. Thus, **community size structure** (i.e., the distribution of individual body sizes regardless of species identity) may provide novel insights to **understand global ecological patterns** and to represent community facets.

The **ACROSS** aims to (i) assess **latitudinal gradients of community size spectrum** of aquatic and terrestrial animals using a **meta-analysis approach** and (ii) determine species richness variations across these ecosystems. With the ACROSS project we will highlight the importance of using size-based approaches to reflect changes at a global scale, improving the knowledge base for the implementation of a **macroecological theory** of bioenergetics with individual body size as a key element. The ACROSS project will also involve international collaboration, result dissemination, and publication in top-ranked scientific journals.

The ACROSS project aims at coupling current knowledge on LGB patterns and size-spectrum theory to better explain the global distribution of biodiversity. Specifically, the project will pursue three objectives (O), which include one hypothesis (H) each:

O1 Identify the role of **individual-based processes** in driving LGB in species richness.
H1 The size-based processes occurring at individual level will determine the unexplained variation of a **classical species richness-climate correlation** (Fig. 1A).

O2 Determine latitudinal biodiversity gradients (LGB) of **size spectrum for animal communities**
H2 There will be a negative relationship between climate temperature and size spectra (i.e., steeper size spectra structure and less biomass supported in the largest body sizes, at warm climates) because increased temperature shrinks individual body size following the **body-sizeâ€“temperature rules** (Fig. 1B).

O3 Identify the differences in LGB of size spectrum across **different taxa and ecosystems**
H3 We will observe flatter size spectrum structure in **marine** than **freshwater** and **terrestrial ecosystems** irrespective of the trophic level considered because marine food webs are longer (and hence, sustain more biomass at largest body sizes) than freshwater and terrestrial systems (Fig. 1C).
